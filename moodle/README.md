# Moodle dev env

## Requirements
- WSL2 with Distro **Ubuntu 24.04**
  ⚠️ Other Distros likely will not work out of the box as of dependency issues.
- Docker Desktop

## Warnings / Hints
- This approach expects apache is not yet used in the WSL instance.
  It will likely break whatever apache is running in the WSL instance.
  If you are already using apache in the WSL instance, you might want to use another `--distribution` for this approach.
  Note that you will likely also have to change the port of the apache server in this case.
- To resolve any issues with shell scripts (typically ^M errors), disable automatic line ending conversion in git by running:
`git config --global core.autocrlf false` or `git config --global core.autocrlf input`

## Preparations
This section will describe how to set up and reset the development environment.

1. Enter WSL. This guide will use shell commands and therefore does not work with the Windows console.
2. Clone this repository to a place of your choice (eg `/home/<wsl username>/AdlerDevelopmentEnvironment`).
3. continue with the following sections

**Note**: Git on Windows has a stupid default setting that can result in line ending error (error message with `^M`) 
when executing shell scripts. To fix this issue
- delete the repository
- disable automatic line ending conversion in git (`git config --global core.autocrlf input`)
- clone the repository again.

## Install Moodle
1) Download Moodle to `/home/<wsl username>/moodle` and AdLer Plugins: `./download_moodle.sh` \
   Plugins are cloned as git repositories, as defined in the [plugin-releases.json](https://github.com/ProjektAdLer/moodle-docker/blob/main/plugin-releases.json) so you can start developing on them directly.
2) Execute the setup Script: `./setup.sh` \
   The [setup.sh bash script](setup.sh) sets up your environment, including installing required packages, setting up the database, and configuring Apache and PHP.

## Access Moodle
- Moodle is available at [http://localhost:5080](http://localhost:5080)
- Default credentials can be taken from [.env](.env) file.

## Further Scripts

### uninstall script

To reset the environment run the [reset_data.sh](reset_data.sh) script.
It will not undo all changes made by the installation script, just delete all data so the setup-script can be run again.

### backup and restore scripts
- [backup_data.sh](backup_data.sh): Creates a backup of Moodle data and database. Run using ./backup_data.sh.
- [restore_data.sh](restore_data.sh): Restores Moodle from a backup. Use it like ./restore_data.sh /path/to/backup.

## Configure development and test tools
The previous steps did just set up the base moodle environment. The following guides will help configuring test and
debug tools.

### Debugging
- [Setup PHPStorm for debugging](doc/debug/configure_phpstorm.md)
- [Windows Firewall Configuration](doc/debug/windows_firewall_setup.md)
  Without this it is not possible for any IDE on Windows to connect to the xdebug server in WSL.
- [Debug Code executed in the shell](doc/debug/command_line_debug.md)

### Testing
- [Behaviour (behat) tests](doc/behat_tests.md)
